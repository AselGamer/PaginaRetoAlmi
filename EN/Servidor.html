        <h1>Web Server</h1>
        <h2>Operating system and Apache2</h2>
        <p>When it came to setting up the web server we were presented with several options and after looking for the most suitable one we decided to install <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server">Ubuntu server 20.04</a>. On our server we have set up a raid 1 configuration to increase the space not only for the website, but also for the file host. (<a href="https://nextcloud.com/">nextcloud</a>), which will be used to make backups and send important files to other team members.</p>

        <h3>Firewall</h3>
        <p>For the firewall (and captive portal) of our network we have used <a href="https://www.untangle.com/">untangle</a>, a free service that anyone with email can use. Our team configured the untangle to create a fast and secure subnet. It also has a captive portal and a VPN server, for which we created a series of clients and downloaded their respective files for use with the mobile and desktop applications, and to add an extra layer of security we also applied mac-blocking.</p>

        <h1>Robot control application</h1>
        <p>We have created an app in appinventor that allows us to control the robot manually from the mobile. The app allows us to control the robot forwards, backwards, to the left, to the right and to stop, we have added a horn as an innovation. To make it work you have to search for bluetooth devices and connect to the BQ robot.</p>

        <h1 class="">Logo</h1>
        <p>We created the logo, the brand image and a banner to advertise our company. We chose colours that were neither too bright nor not very bright, we also put the name of our company "DOGMA" and we took a pendrive to give visibility to IT.</p>
